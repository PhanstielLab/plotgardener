## NEW FEATURES

* `hicTriangles` and `hicRectangles` can now be annotated with `annoDomains`
or `annoPixels` if they are flipped.


# CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.17
## NEW FEATURES

* `plotIdeogram` can now accept custom colors with a `fill` parameter. Colors
can be specified with a named or unnamed vector. To see which stains are being
assigned which colors, look inside the `ideogram` object.

# CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.16

## BUG FIXES 

* ENTREZ IDs obtained from `AnnotationDbi::select()` are subset just for
`ENTREZID` column when determining default gene priorities, eliminating `dplyr`
incompatible types error.
* All plus and minus strand gene name label parsing in `plotGenes` is now 
carried out only if there is a non-zero number of that strand's 
genes.

# CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.15

error if the input chromosome is not found in the chromosomes listed in 
the .hic file.

# CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.11

## BUG FIXES 

* `annoDomains` coordinates fixed for `plotHicRectangle`.
